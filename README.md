### Handwritten Character Recognition Using Machine Learning

This project was built as part of the Capstone Project for my Masters in Data Science at South Dakota State University.

The purpose of this project is to constuct classifiers that predict the letter of a handwritten english character based on the pixel information of a 56 by 56 bitmap image. To do so, two data sets are given, defined as "Labeled" and "Unlabeled". The recommended model is used to predict the labels on the "Unlabeled" dataset. The accuracy of the prediction should be greater than 70% to get through the degree. The accuracy of the recommended model for this project was **89.9%**.

#### Dataset Information
The labeled data set contains 10440 observations, 3136 variables and labels to each observation. The value of the variables are either 0 or 1 based on the pixel information of the 56x56 image, '0' denoting empty pixels and '1' denoting shaded pixels. The unlabeled data set contains pixel information on 2000 observations without the labels on them.
